PSSI (Python Software Society of India) Guidelines and Policies.

The guidelines presented here are expected to be used as reasonable rules to aid the PSSI members and PyCon India conference
organizers to help in decision making.

As of now the guidelines are in draft form.

The word __guideline__ and __policy__ have been used rather interchangeably throughout the guidelines document. As of now there
is no clear demarcation between both these terms - and the general meaning of both is the less stricter meaning of __guidelines__ . However once this document is adopted by the organization some of the guidelines might be converted to more strict
policies.

It is expected that the PSSI core community and the PyCon India core organzing committee members would contribute to these
guidelines so that we can adopt a version of this as standard operating guidelines for PSSI and PyCon India in the AGM
after PyCon India 2014.
