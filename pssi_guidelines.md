Some notes about adding/editing guidelines.

   1. A guideline should be short, sweet and to the point.
   1. A guideline should not be rambling, but focussed.
   1. A guideline should be able to be followed or implemented, hence it should be
   focussed more on specifics and less on generalities.
   1. A guideline should be keeping in with the broad principles of the organisation.
   1. A guideline should be written in unambiguous language as much as possible so
   as to not leave room for loopholes or conflicting interpretations.
   
## FAQ

   1. What does __"PSSI"__ stand for ?
   The name __PSSI__ stands for the organization _Python Software Society of India_. It is a non-profit organization that manages annual __PyCon India__ conference and also other activities to promote Python programming language in India.

   1. Can you tell me something about the history and background of __PSSI__ ?
   PyCon India started in 2009 as a result of efforts by Noufal Ibrahim and a team of dedicated volunteers.
   In order to create an umbrella society for managing funds for PyCon India, the late Kenneth Gonsalves
   registered __Indian Python Software Society (IPSS)__ in 2010 in Ooty, Tamilnadu.
   After the sad demise of Kenneth in August 2012, there was nobody to manage the affairs of __IPSS__ in Ooty.
   In order to create an organization which could continue to be the centre of organizing affairs of PyCon
   India and related efforts, it was decided in an SGM of IPSS to register a new organization for the same
   in Bangalore, since most of the organizing members of PyCon India were based in Bangalore at that time.
   Thus, PSSI was registered in Bangalore in 2013 as the new society for managing affairs related to PyCon India.

   1. How do I become a member of the PSSI ?
   In order to become a lifetime member of the PSSI you need to satisfy the following.
      * You need to be an Indian citizen.
      * Pay a once lifetime membership fee of INR 600/- to register yourself as a member.

   1. What are the benefits of being a PSSI member ?
      1. Be able to attend the Annual General Meeting (AGM) every year and make your voice heard in
      making the society policies and in the conduct and organization of PyCon India conference.
      1. Be able to stand for elections to the PSSI board and influence changes from a position
      of power.
      1. Apart from these, PSSI provides a platform for exerting a very powerful influence on
      the use and adoption of Python programming language in academic & industrial areas. Being
      part of PSSI allows you to make your voice heard and be a prominent part of this influence.

   1. Is PSSI related to PSF (Python Software Foundation) in any way ?
   PSSI is not directly connected to PSF in any organizational or hierarchical manner. However PSSI can
   be thought of as a counterpart of PSF globally in an Indian context. What PSF aims to do in terms
   of providing a direction and being the single organisational body for the Python programming language
   globally (and with a specific focus in the U.S.A), PSSI aims to do with a focus on India.

   However it is to be noted that PSF has more at stake in the Python programming language than PSSI.
   For example, the Intellectual Property, Copyright and Trademarks of Python Programming language
   are vested in the PSF. PSSI has no such rights on Python. The primary focus of PSSI as of today is
   the organization and conduct of PyCon India conference and associated events annually.

   It is also worth mentioning that PSSI has received funds from PSF for conducting PyCon India in the past
   and might receive such funds in the future as well. However PSF has no say in the governance and
   conduct of the board members of PSSI.

   1. What are the board positions of PSSI ?
   The board positions of PSSI to which annual elections are held every year include,

      1. President.
      1. Vice-President.
      1. Secretary.
      1. Treasurer.
      1. Joint-Secretary (?)

   1. When is the AGM of PSSI held ?
   The AGM (Annual General Meeting) of PSSI is held every year on the last day of PyCon India conference
   in the same venue. The last AGM was held in Sep 1 2013 at NIMHANS Convention Centre, Bangalore.

## PSSI Guidelines

The following are guidelines from PSSI on various organizational matters. Most of them are focussed on the conduct
and organization of PyCon India. Others are related to administrative matters, funding of other activities, Python Month (Python Express), policies, conflict resolution etc.


### PyCon India
All guidelines and policies related to organization and conduct of PyCon India.

#### Conference Host City
There was an original policy of  trying to conduct PyCon India every year in a different city. We had conducted
PyCon India 2011 in the city of Pune as well. However, PyCon India 2012 which was planned to be done in Pune
had to be shifted to Bangalore due to lack of support in the organizational infrastructure on the ground.

For a city to host PyCon India, it should have a well developed local Python user group and also some local
leadership with some experience in conducting and running conferences - in a small or medium-large scale. Since
it was perceived that it would take some time for some of the other cities to catch up to Bangalore in terms
of this kind of support and leadership talent, the original policy of trying to conduct PyCon India every year
in a different city has been put on suspension after the experience of 2012.

PSSI has been organizing __Python Month__ and also helping to organize some mini conferences in other cities
since then. In the future, if it is perceived that some other cities are capable to organize PyCon India with
sufficient grass root organizational culture and leadership, the conference could be moved out of Bangalore.
Even then a rotational policy would emerge at best, rotating the conference among a few candidate cities
including Bangalore.

As of writing this guideline, the default host city of the conference is __Bangalore__ and we don't perceive this
to change unless other candidate cities emerge in the future. The question of conference host city is at this point
an irrelevant one as it defaults to Bangalore.

#### Conference Venue (Actual Physical Location)
The conference should be conducted in a location that is ideally,

Primarily,

   1. Reasonably central in the host city. 
   1. Well accessible by Road, Rail and Air.
   1. Has a clutch of good hotels and restaurants nearby.
   1. At least 2 large halls with possibly a central Hall (for Keynotes).

Seconadarily,

   1. Halls are ideally situated on the ground floor so that
   attendees don't need elaborate directions to reach them.
   1. Good A/V or possiblity/space for arranging good A/V.
   1. Good projector infrastructure.
   1. Reasonable Acoustics in Halls and Rooms.

A good example of a venue that satisfies most of this criteria is __NIMHANS Convention Centre, Bangalore__ .

#### Conference Format
We have been following a format of 3 days of conference with the 1st day for Workshops followed by 2 days of talks since PyCon India 2012. This format is unchanged as of the upcoming PyCon India (2014) as well.

There have been discussions of adding days for Coding and development sprints on Python or Python projects. So far
these have not been attempted yet. It is expected that in the future the conference retains the current format
with possibly more days added for other activities including but not limited to coding sprints.

#### Mailing Lists
The public mailing list for PyCon India is __inpycon@python.org__ . All open discussions and public matters would be conducted in this mailing list.

There is a private mailing list for the conference organizers which is __contact@in.pycon.org__ . Matters which are perceived to be discussed in a more private space would be sent to this address.

There is no hard and fast rule on which mailing list a topic would be discussed on. However the following can be used as guidelines.

##### Discussions on private ML (contact@in.pycon.org)

   1. Any discussions with Sponsors on sponsorship details.
   1. Updates on sponsorship status - Such as confirmation, details of money paid, bank statements, remittances etc.
   1. Policy discussions related to PyCon India in early stages which don't need general input.
   1. Discussions on what is percieved as sensitive matters which might be too broad for the public ML.
   1. Discussion related to decisions on conference sub-topics which don't need general input - E.g: T-shirt design, Food vendor decision etc.
   1. Any discussion initiated by a PSSI board member/PyCon India organizer meant for other PSSI board members/PyCon India organizers and not for the general public.

Note that some of the topics above might overlap in practice.

##### Discussions on public ML (inpycon@python.org)

The topics on public ML can be vast so it is not possible to cover them all here. Instead some examples follow.

   1. Discussions on conference schedules, keynote speakers etc.
   1. All discussions on Volunteer related topics.
   1. Discussions on conference and/or ML etiquette, posting guidelines etc.
   1. Discussions on accomodation, access to venue etc.
   1. Discussions on Python Month (Python Express).
   1. All public notifications and updates on PyCon India or Python Month (Python Express).

Generally speaking, any topic which is perceived to be related to Core Policy, Core Organizational Matter, Internal Details of PyCon India Conduct & Management, Financial Details, Sensitive Matters etc are to be addressed to the private ML. Any other topic can be safely addressed to the public ML.

It has also been observed that during last few years, there was a tendency to shift even open, public matters to the internal ML. This practice is not encouraged since it is important to engage the general Python community in conference decisions as much as possible unless for very core, organizational decisions. Hence it is encouraged that you use your critical judgement when deciding to post a matter to the internal vs public ML. You can use the above guidelines to help you.

#### Sponsorship

Kindly note that there is a separate prospectus which talks about sponsorships in more detail. This section is an attempt
to sketch out the sponsorship classifications broadly and also some policies about soliciting/obtaining Sponsorship
from companies.

PSSI uses sponsorships to pay for most of the costs of organizing PyCon India. While sponsorships help the organization in
a large way to offset the costs of the conference, it also helps the Sponsors to use the conference as a visible outpost
for advertising their solutions and technologies and also (in most cases) to attract possible employee talent from the
conference attendees.

The broad Sponsorship tiers are,

   1. __Platinum__ - This is the top most tier and should be limited to at most 2 sponsors and ideally just 1.
   1. __Gold__ - This is the next tier and should be limited to at most 5 sponsors.
   1. __Silver__ - The bottom most tier. This should be used for entry level sponsorships and should be advised to
   startups and companies low on sponsorship budget. The limit here can be adjusted based on financial requirements
   though it is suggested to keep it at 10 sponsors max.

The Sponsorship tier details can be found in the Sponsorship prospectus (please insert link here).

##### Sponsorship Dos and Don'ts

   1. __Dos__
      1. Strive for variety in sponsorship companies. Variety can be in terms of company size, technologies or cities.
      For example it is a good practice to try and get more companies from outside the hosting city to support the
      conference.
      1. Try as much as possible for new sponsors every year instead of repeating sponsors. This is best tried at
      entry level tiers such as Silver though at the highest tiers this may not be feasible due to relations
      with companies over the years of the conference. However in order to keep the distinct independent image of
      the conference, it might be a good idea to try and restrict companies from continuously sponsoring at
      a certain level for not more than 3 years (- this point needs discussion before adopting).
      1. As much as possible, involve companies working in the Python programming language as sponsors. Quite
      often practicality beats purity so this might be difficult to enforce in every case, but should be seen
      as an overarching principle when selecting one sponsor over another.


   1. __Don'ts__ 
      1. Avoid Sponsorships from companies where any of the PSSI board members has a stake or is part of the director
      board or any other panel in official capacity. This is to avoid any possible conflict of interests. Similary
      avoid any Sponsorship requests specifically __recommended__ by any PSSI board member or key conference organizer.
      Organizers and PSSI board members should ideally desist from suggesting sponsors to which they have any personal
      or professional connection.
      1. Avoid Sponsorships from companies which put in a conditional clause with regard to talk selection. For example,
      if company __X__ suggests they will do Gold sponsorship if two of their employee talks are accepted, it should be
      outrightly rejected. Talk selection is a completely independent process and should remain so.
      1. Avoid sponsorship in direct funds from foreign entities. Instead have them refund some of the costs incurred
      to vendors directly such as Food, T-Shirt etc.
      1. Group or collective sponsorships are a no-no. For example if company __X__ mentions they will sponsor conditionally
      along with sister company __Y__ only if both are accepted, it is a case for outright rejection. However this shouldn't
      prevent the PSSI board from looking at each case separately and making an individual decision if that is possible.
      1. Avoid sponsorships or special marketing requests linked with Keynote talks. For example if a keynote speaker
      __Opportunistic Keynoter__, suggests he would consider appearing for keynote only if his company
      __Opportunistic Company__ as a sponsor, it is a clear case of rejection of both. (More on marketing requirements
      on keynote speakers in a separate section).
      1. Avoid concessions or special requests for companies over and above what is allowed in their respective
      sponsorship tiers as much as possible.


#### Speakers & Talks
All policies/guidelines regarding call for proposals, talk selection, scheduling, cancellation, speaker registration etc.

##### CFP (Call For Proposal)
Call for proposals are open calls by the conference organizers to the Python speaking public for talk/workshop proposals.
Here are the CFP guidelines.

   1. CFP should be announced at least 6 months before the conference dates to give enough time for the
   prospective speakers to think about their proposals and submit them.
   1. There should be at least a gap of 3 months between CPF announcement and the CFP submission deadline.
   1. There should be at least 1 month for CFP evaluation process so as to give enough time for
   the evaluators to assess the proposals.
   1. The CFP system should try to provide a public voting option for anyone to vote up/down the proposals.
   However the system should also have some in-built techniques to avoid gaming/abuse of the voting option.
   1. The final dates for the different stages of the CFP should be clearly mentioned at the time of
   CFP announcement. This should not be changed later once announced and put on the Conference site.
   However the less important dates such as _dates for proposal upload_ could be modified if absolutely
   required.
   1. The CFP URL should be a part of the main conference website.
   1. CFP should clearly provide unambiguous, non-overlapping topic suggestions for submission of talks/workshop proposals.

Here are some more general principles to keep in mind w.r.t the CFP.

   1. When adding new topics try to keep away from industry overused or "hyped" up terms and use terms closer to their
   technological base to avoid ambiguity. For example, "NoSQL" is preferred over "Big Data" as the latter is a rather
   overused term in the industry circles.
   1. Limit the number of top-level topics to no more than 10.

###### Multiple Speakers
We often get requests for > 1 speaker for a talk/workshop. The guidelines for this are,

   1. More than 1 speaker is allowed if the topic/subject matter seem to require it and if the submitter has mentioned
   this at the time of the proposal submission.
   1. If the submitter hasn't mentioned this at proposal submission time, the author has to clearly explain why
   he/she thinks now that more than 1 speaker is required. If the explanation makes sense, we can take a call on
   allowing it.  Otherwise, the CFP panel can decide on allowing only 1 speaker or dropping the talk itself.
   1. The primary speaker has to remain the same to allow >1 speaker.
   1. For talks, at most 2 speakers are allowed.
   1. For workshops, it is more common to have >1 speaker or participant. However this has to be indicated at the
   time of the proposal submission. For any change after proposal submission the same rules as above apply.

###### Change of Speaker
Rarely we have got requests in the past from a speaker to substitute someone else in his/her place due to unforeseen circumstances. The policies to deal with this situation are,

   1. The speaker has to send a written request (Email) clearly mentioning the reason why he/she cannot make it for the
   talk.
   1. The speaker has to suggest the alternate person to deliver the talk himelf/herself and forward the consent email
   from this person to the CFP contact/internal ML clearly stating he/she is fine in delivering this talk in the place
   of the original person.
   1. The substitute person should have enough subject matter expertise to deliver the session competently.
   1. The substitute person has to make his/her arrangements for travel/stay. It is not the burden of PyCon India organizers
   to arrange it.
   1. If any of the above conditions are not met, the CFP lead would be at liberty to cancel the talk and substitute
   another talk/session in its place. 


##### Talk Proposal Selection
Here are some guidelines with respect to selecting talks.

   1. __Panel__ 
      1. The talk selection panel shouldn't be limited to the PSSI board or the PyCon organizing committee but should
      involve at least 2 _independents_ - people with no direct responsibility or connection to PyCon India or PSSI.
      This is in the interests of fairness and to avoid any possible accusation of the talk selection being done without
      transparency.
      1. The talk selection panel should involve a set of experienced people with varied backgrounds.
      1. The talk selection panel should have a size of at least 5 people and no more than 8.
      1. It is preferred to select people with some experience in Python or those who are widely acclaimed or accepted
      as some kind of expert in their chosen fields. Any previous talk selection panel experience is a plus but is not
      required.
      1. Each talk proposal should be reviewed by at least 80% of the panel to be adjudged as __review complete__ .
      
   1. __Talk Review__
      1. The talks should be selected on basis of the following.
         * __Proposal strength__ - Is the proposal well thought out and structured ?
         * __Topic knowledge__ - Does the author know about the topic well enough to talk about it ?
         * __Scope__ - Is the proposal strucured to fit the time slot or is it too ambitious ?
         * __Speaker__ - Is the speaker a reputed one ? If he is a new speaker, does it look like he can deliver this talk well ?
         * __Upvotes__ - The reviewer can also use the +1 votes for a talk by the public as a signal, but be careful when
         using this since it is possible to game this system. It is suggested to not use this signal in exclusivity.
         * __Filters__ - You can use the following filters to help your decision. Filters are marked with a + or a - indicating
         signals for selection and non-selection respectively.
            * (-)__Banality Filter__ - Is the proposal subject a common enough one that one can learn it from an article or
              tutorial from the Internet ? 
            * (+)__Interest Filter__ - Would there be a significant group of likely audience for this talk ? 
            * (+)__Novelty Filter__ - Is the proposal breaking new ground or is about a topic that is not very common. If
              so, apply the Interest filter on top to decide on selection.
            * (-)__Repetition Filter__ - Has the talk or the talk topic been given in recent PyCons ? If so, it is less
              of a candidate for selection. However a very popular talk could get repeated often and there is nothing
              wrong in selecting it, so use this filter wisely.
            * (-)__Dis-reputation Filter__ - Used to not select talks whose topics or speakers have a known disreputation
              in PyCon or other forums.
            * (+)__Personal Interest Filter__ - Would I go for this talk ? Please note that this is a very biased filter, so
              it is suggested to apply it only as a last resort.
      1. Each reviewer should upvote (+1) or downvote (-1) a talk on the basis of the above review criteria. He can also
      chose to remain neutral (0) if he cannot make up his mind.
      1. In Phase #1 review, any talks with no -1s are accepted. Any talk with >3 -1s are rejected.
      Remaining talks move to Phase #2 where reviews happen in groups. (Please update the review process in Phase #2).

Once talk selection is finalized, the leader of the CFP panel should,

   1. Send email to individual speakers whose talks are accepted.
   1. It is a good etiquette to also inform speakers whose talks are rejected at this stage.
   1. Update the status of selected talks to __Confirmed__ in the CFP page.
   1. Make the proper announcements in public channels of the Conference such as the conference blog, twitter stream etc
   as applicable.
   1. Ask the speakers to send an email reply confirming their talk selection acceptance clearly.

##### Talk Cancellation
The policies to deal with talk cancellation are,

   1. The CFP submission form should state clearly that proposal submitters should consider submitting a proposal
   only if they are reasonably sure of attending the conference and delivering the talk if selected. In other words,
   any possible cancellations can be rooted out at this stage itself by dissuading such proposals from getting submitted.
   1. At CFP submission stage (before confirmation), talks can be canceled/revoked by submitters with impunity.
   Nothing need to be done.
   1. For a confirmed talk, it should be made clear in the email to the Speaker to inform of any potential talk
   cancellations within a fixed deadline - this deadline should be short, a minium of 1 week to a maximum of 1 month.
   1. If a Speaker withdraws/cancels his/her selected talk within this timeframe, the next ranked talk should be
   substituted in its place after confirming with that talk's Speaker.
   1. If a Speaker withdraws/cancels his/her selected talk at the last minute (< week to go for the conference),
   and we are not in a position to substitute it with other talks, the following can be done.
      1. Alter schedules if possible so that the slot is moved down to the end of the day.
      1. Schedule an impromptu session (BoF session/lightning talk) in its place.
      1. Get someone part of the conference - Organizer, Core PSSI member or someone else to deliver a talk  in its place.
      1. Please also note that speakers who withdraw confirmed talks in the last minute in this fashion should be
      identified and blacklisted for the next year's conference. Evaluation of their proposals in future PyCons should
      consider this aspect with prominence.

##### Speaker Registration
PyCon India didn't have a clear policy till 2013 with regards to conference registration for Speakers. This section
aims to clear the ambiguity with respect to this.

   1. Speakers have to register for the conference just like the other participants.
   1. However PyCon India will provide a discount to Speakers. This discount coupon code would be sent along with the
   proposal acceptance email or immediately following it to the Speaker. The actual discount percentage could vary and
   is not part of this guideline.
   1. The CFP should state it clearly that such a discount would be provided for accepted talk so that prospective
   speakers can make the individual decision on whether to register early (without the discount) or to wait till
   proposal submissions are announced to avail off the possible discount.
   1. The registration system should try and provide a mechanism for speakers to convert any regular registration
   to the speaker discounted registration.
   1. The discount coupon code should be distinct and make it clear it is meant for speakers only. For example
   "SPEAKER2014" is a good code whereas "SPONSOR2014" is not.
   1. Speakers who cancel their talks but still attend the conference shouldn't avail of this discount. The
   system should make sure any such cancellation of talks would be followed by a revocation of the discount code
   for the speaker from the registration system.
   1. One speaker can avail the discount just once irrespective of the number of sessions he/she is presenting.
   1. It is strictly forbidden to abuse the discount code by passing it off to a friend or someone else attending
   the conference if the speaker decides to not use it. 


#### Registration & Attendance
All policies & guidelines regarding conference registration, ticket pricing, attendance, cancellation, refund and related matters like attendance certificate, financial aid, hotel policy, travel policy etc.

##### Registration Platform
There is no detailed guideline with respect to the registration platform. An appropriate online web platform should be used for registrations with good support for a variety of credit/debit card transactions, discounts, different classes of tickets and supporting analytics and viewable statistics.


##### Early-bird Tickets
A certain percentage of tickets every year is announced early in the registration process as __Early bird__ tickets with
significant discount from the regular price.

   1. Early bird ticket price should not be less than 60% of the regular price.
   1. Early bird tickets should be announced once with a fixed number of tickets, a count not exceeding
   40% of the total ticket count.
   1. Early bird tickets should be announced first and be open for a limited time - not exceeding
   1 month. It is not advised to extend the early bird ticketing scheme beyond the original timeframe
   and to also add more tickets to this class.
   1. It is suggested to create a separate class of discounted tickets for members of PSSI and the core
   organizing committee which is not publicly announced so that they can get a reduced price and not
   compete with the public on the early bird tickets (please vote on this guideline).

##### Student Tickets/Discounts
(This is a new area opened up in PyCon India 2014. I suggest those who worked with student discounts and aware of the
issues here to add the guidelines).

##### Tickets for Sponsors


##### Tickets for Partners

##### Regular Registration

##### Cancellation & Re-fund

##### Attendance Certificate
PyCon India does not provide any default certificate to attendees of the conference. Still we get many requests asking for such certificates - typically from the academic participants for purposes of leave confirmation, student absence etc.

The general policy with respect to such requests is that,

   1. We can provide a letter of attendance to participants upon an explicit request from the participant if
   the participant has actually attended the conference. The reason for the certificate has to be clearly
   stated and should be a valid one.
   1. Such certificates are issued only to attendees from academic or government institutes. We don't issue
   certificates of attendance to corporate or private participants.
   1. The certificates would be issue as a soft-copy only with the organization seal and signature of
   a PSSI board member and emailed to the requester's email address. No hard copy certificates would be given.
   1. It is also proposed that a software system be setup - with authentication - to automate the printing
   of such digital attendance certificates so as to automate and simplify this process. However the system
   wouldn't be shared to the requesters, instead used internally to generate the required certificates.

##### Financial Aid for Attendees
##### Hotel Policy
##### Travel Policy
